/*
 REMARK: it seems that the angles of the servos do not correspond to normal angle, by that, it is ment that if a servo must
 go to 180 degrees from an initial position of 0, it will make more than half a circle. To counter this problem, we have seen
 that the best way for a servo to make 180 degrees (irl), is to make it sweep from 5 to 150 degrees. We do not begin at 0 degrees,
 because they are then tensions in the servos (they vibrate).
