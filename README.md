**Abstract:**
The code that can be found in this repository allows to control servos and an accelerometer trough node using either CHIP or CHIP Pro, the code is especially adapted to control a remote controled cylinder driven through a web page that moves when its gravity center is displaced. To obtain all the information about the hardware of the cylinder, visit: https://github.com/opatiny/tm

The functions that were developed here are:

*The formula allowing the mass in the center of the cylinder to be moved on a circle of given radius
