# CHIP and CHIP Pro code dedicated to the programming of a remote control cylinder

  [![build status][travis-image]][travis-url]
  [![Test coverage][codecov-image]][codecov-url]

**Abstract:**
The code that can be found in this repository allows to control servos and an accelerometer trough node using either CHIP or CHIP Pro, the code is especially adapted to control a remote controled cylinder driven through a web page that moves when its gravity center is displaced. To obtain all the information about the hardware of the cylinder, visit: https://github.com/opatiny/rc2.

__Caution:__ Since C.H.I.P. made bankrupt, the code contained in this repository is no longer useful. Therefore, it has been adapted to work on a Raspberry Pi Nano W. To see the new code, click [here](https://github.com/opatiny/rpi-cylinder).
